A neural chatbot using sequence to sequence model with attentional decoder. This is a fully functional chatbot.

This is based on Google Translate Tensorflow model https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/rnn/translate/

#PLEASE USE TENSORFLOW VERSION 1.X FOR THIS CHATBOT.
#IF YOU WANT TO RUN IT ON GOOGLE COLAB CHANGE THE DATA FOLDER TO '/content/'
#I have run both on Google Colab and a Windows machine
#All training have been done on Windows machine with Pythin 3.6 and TF 1.4


Usage for TRAINING:




Step 1: update config.py file. open the file you will understand.
Change DATA_PATH to where you store your data

step 2: run all the file in sequential order till 'python chatbot.py --mode train'

step 3: once you think that the model loss is not changing much stop the training .

step 4: we will now train our model only on joey_data() so as to give our boa a personality. run the cell 'python chatbot.py --mode train_joey' and it will trind on friends dataset for joey character.


if you ave error sating 'ehs not equal to lhs' remove the last two ENC_VOCAB and DEC_VOCAB because my model checkpoints stored the data for whole dataset.

step 7: after removing save the file and run 'python chatbot.py --mode chat' block to chat with the bot.



usage for CHATTING AND FEEDBACK:

i have trained the chatbot for 26000+ epochs 19000 for whole data(loss 2.87) and rest for just joey.(loss was around 0.05)

step 1: adjust paths in checkpoint file and config.py

step 2 :run python chatbot --mode chat, it should restore the weights and dictionaries and start. Please observe the feedback on the screen.


step 3: if you want to give feedback then simply type keyword 'feedback:' followed by correction if you dont like the answer.
for example: 
user>> where do you live.
bot>> <unk>.
user>> feedback:I live in New-York.

step 5 :press enter and continue chatting ,you can provide multiple feedback in single session.
step 6 :once you think you are done and want to close the chat simply press 'enter'. 
step 7 :after you end the session the bot will train the model for the feedbacks you provided.It will take time, be patient while it does that.


Notes:-

If mode is train, then you train the chatbot. By default, the model will restore the previously trained weights (if there is any) and continue training up on that.

If you want to start training from scratch, please delete all the checkpoints in the checkpoints folder.

If the mode is chat, you'll go into the interaction mode with the bot.

By default, all the conversations you have with the chatbot will be written into the file output_convo.txt in the processed folder.
